# Technologies Used

* Backend: PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Javascript, Express
* Heroku(website hosting)

# Live Site Demo
[DEMO LINK](https://courtbnb.herokuapp.com/)

# Installation
Clone courtbnb into your desired directory:
* run `npm install` in BOTH the `backend` and `frontend` directories to install required dependencies
* create an `.env` file in your `backend` and refer to the `.env.example` file provided for you in the `backend`
* refer to [SEQUELIZE DOCUMENTATION](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/) on how to create a database
* to run the app in development mode `CD` into BOTH the `backend` and `frontend` in two different terminals, and run `npm start`
* open up your browser and head to `localhost:3000` where you will see courtbnb in action!

# Challenges
* A challenge I ran into while building this app was constantly thinking about the state and how it is changing.
* Once I got into a rhythm it became a lot easier to build the frontend with react and redux while always keeping the state shape in mind.
* The biggest challenge for me was styling the app and trying to make it look somewhat presentable.
